### DFM


DFMis a Trajectory planner simulator. It is developed by tahereh koohi, a Phd student from University of shahrood 
DFM is not yet fully completed and we welcome your contribution to this project. 

This page introduces the basic features of dfm and how to install and run it with Eclipse or NetBeans.

### 1. Use dfm with GitHub/Eclipse

( It is suggested to use WorkflowSim if you are going to contribute back to this project, otherwise it is not required. )


1.1 Register a GitHub account and fork your own branch

Go to the repository page (https://github.com/tkoohi/dfm) and click 'Fork' on the top-right corner next to 'Star'. Then you will have your own branch of WorkflowSim and you can maintain your codes under this branch and commit your changes to it. In this example, we use 'chenww05' as an example and you will see a new repo called chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0. Go to your repo, and copy the path. In this case, it is "https://github.com/chenww05/dfm.git".
